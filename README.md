Yellow Taxi have served as the international icon of New York City, but after Uber
first launched in New York City in 2011, this new ride sharing service has undoubtedly 
affected the traditional taxi industry. However, in recent years, as Uber fares surge 
and with the launch of the taxi app "Curb",Yellow Taxi is becoming popular again. Ride-sharing
companies such as Uber have traditionally had a competitive, antagonistic relationship with
taxi companies, but this year Uber is teaming up with taxi companies in NYC. In the long
development of traditional Taxi companies and the impossible partnership after years of rivalry.
There are a lot of questions we can dig into by processing the Yellow Taxi and Uber data in NYC. 
Using NYC taxi trip data and Uber data, I am going to explore these few questions:

1. Some basic questions about the Yellow Taxi Trip data in 2021: Where the Yellow Taxi
pick-ups often occur and Is there a pattern behind the distribution of pick-ups hour in a day?
What's the possible factors that affect the number of pick-ups? 

2. Compare the hourly pick-up counts for Yellow Taxi and Uber to see if there exists some kind
of association between the Yellow Taix and Uber pick-up counts in a given time period.

3. If the crime rate of one area can influence the pick-ups for Uber/Taxi drivers?

4. Explore two factors:payment type and pick-up time, which might be the factors that
influence the tipping behavior of passengers.
